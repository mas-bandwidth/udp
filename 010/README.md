# 010

The only way to pass this test is to break the rules of the test.

Drop the server <-> backend HTTP requests and switch from Golang to XDP.

To run:

```console
terraform init
terraform apply
```

Result:

We can now run 100k clients for each c3-highcpu-44 instance, so we only need ten of them now instead of 200. This is a 20X cost saving from $481,114 USD per-month to $24,055 for the VMs.

But there are still the egress bandwidth charges, and these dominate. Surely at such a scale, the egress bandwidth price would be greatly reduced with sales negotiations with Google Cloud, but let's go a step further.

Let's run the system in bare metal.

I love https://datapacket.com. They are an excellent bare metal hosting company. Picking the fattest bare metal server they have with a 40GB bandwidth plan, there are no ingress or egress bandwidth charges past the the monthly cost.

On bare metal with a 40GB NIC we can handle the amount of traffic easily with XDP. The XDP program runs in native mode, whereas on google cloud it runs in SKB mode, so it's slower. There's also no virtualization overhead. All the cores on the bare metal are dedicated exclusively to doing the XDP work and you can tune the system as needed.

More about XDP here: https://mas-bandwidth.com/xdp-for-game-programmers/

The total cost for 1M clients is now: $8,430 USD per-month.

$1,746,010 / $8,430 = 207X reduction in cost.

Can we take it even further? Yes!

If we needed to scale up more, at some point XDP is not fast enough. 

We could purchase and install a netronome NIC that would run the XDP hash function in hardware. Alternatively, we could explore implementing the hash on a programmable NIC using P4.

If we need to scale up even further, perhaps another 100 - 1000X, we could scale out horizontally with multiple bare metal machines with NICs that have onboard FPGA and implement the hash there. _Although, this is mildly insane._

What's the moral of the story?

1. Work out how much it costs
2. Prototype it, load test it and really understand the problem
3. Don't be afraid to break the rules to get it to scale :)
