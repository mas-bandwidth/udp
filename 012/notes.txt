25k clients with XDP is ~10% of a c3-highcpu-44, set to one thread per-core (so, 22 cores, 16 recv queues...)

100k clients with XDP is ~22% of a c3-highcpu-44

250k clients with XDP is ... can't do it. it stops working.

Therefore, will cost 10 c3-highcpu-44 scaling horizontally to do it. It's probably cheaper to do this than to go to a higher instance type.

Cost is ~2254.14 * 10 = 22k per-month, just for to VMs

Add egress bandwidth

Add load balancer ingress bandwidth 1c per-GB, I think...

It's a lot :)
